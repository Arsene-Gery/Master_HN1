# Clustering Religious Traditions: Examining the Divergent Modes of Religiosity Theory

Project Description

This project explores the Divergent Modes of Religiosity (DMR) theory, proposed by Harvey Whitehouse, which categorizes religious traditions into imagistic and doctrinal modes. Using statistical methods and data visualization techniques, the study analyses ritual data from the eHRAF world cultures database. The primary goals are to test the replicability of Whitehouse's categories within a statistical framework and to uncover hidden patterns within the data. By making use of techniques such as hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA), this project provides a robust quantitative foundation for understanding the relationship between ritual content and societal structure. My research project aims to contribute to the broader field of cultural anthropology by offering new insights into the creation and differentiation of religious traditions.
