# Clustering Religious Traditions: Examining the Divergent Modes of Religiosity Theory

Project Description

This project explores the Divergent Modes of Religiosity (DMR) theory, proposed by Harvey Whitehouse, which categorizes religious traditions into imagistic and doctrinal modes. Utilizing advanced statistical methods and data visualization techniques, the study analyzes ritual data from the eHRAF world cultures database. The primary goals are to test the replicability of Whitehouse's categories within a statistical framework and to uncover hidden patterns within the data. By employing techniques such as hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and various visualization tools, the project aims to provide a robust quantitative foundation for understanding the relationship between ritual content and societal structure. This research contributes to the broader field of cultural anthropology by offering new insights into the formation and differentiation of religious traditions, and sets the stage for future investigations using machine learning models to predict ritual actions based on socio-religious contexts.
